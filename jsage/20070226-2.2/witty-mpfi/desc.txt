This patch implements a couple more MPFI functions (magnitude and
intersection).  It implements a new comparison framework, where
partially ordered sets can implement comparison operators consistent
with the partial ordering.  It also adds access to a few more Pari
features in gen.pyx (polred, rnfequation, nffactor, modreverse).
