Well after all that crap, it turned out the fastest solution was by
far the simplest --- Robert's list comprehensions are utterly
wonderful.

So basically this patch speeds up obtaining the list of coefficients
of an NTL polynomial in Z[x]. The speedup is not terribly dramatic,
maybe a factor of two or three. I should point out however that the
actual data conversion is now taking practically zero time; all the
time now appears to be in the integer constructor/destructor.
