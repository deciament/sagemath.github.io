<h2><a href="index.html">JSAGE</a> Publication Procedure</h2>

<h3>1. Submit your software</h3>


<ul>
<li> All code submissions must be licensed under <a
href="http://opensource.org">OSI approved open source license</a>.
No exceptions will be made. 
<li> <b>Submitting additions to the SAGE library:</b> Submit your code
to <a href="editors.html">one of the editors via email</a>
as a Mercurial patch bundle or plain text Mercurial patch.
In some cases code submitted not as a bundle will be accepted.

<li> <b>Submitting new software packages:</b> This is more
complicated; please contact one of the editors and describe
the software you would like to submit to SAGE.

</ul>

<h3>2. Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li> A referee (either <a href="editors.html">one of the editors</a>
or someone chosen by an editor) will review your work.  This is <i>not</i>
anonymous.  The referee will provide feedback about the quality
of the submission: 
  <ul>
    <li> Does it make sense for publication in JSAGE?
    <li> Is it sufficiently well documented?  
    <li> Is the theory on which the algorithms depend solid.
    <li> Is the source code comprehensible and maintainable?
    <li> Are copyright statements and authorship clearly stated in the code.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>3. Response</h3>
<ul>
<li> If the referee decides that the submission is suitable for
publication in JSAGE, the author and referee work together to
make all necessary changes.  
</ul>

<h3>4. Publication</h3>

The final decision for all software submissions to SAGE rests
with the managing editor. 
<ul>
<li> When the referee/response process is complete, 
all relevant patches are made available to the managing editor.  
These patches should include author statements and mention any referees
or editors that were involved in refereeing the submission.
<li> When possible, we strongly encourage JSAGE authors
to also  contribute corresponding mathematical research
articles to <a href="journals.html">these endorsed journals</a>.

<li> Citing your paper. For example
<pre>
 Carl Witty, {\em Implementation of Interval Arithmetic} (500 lines of
 code), JSAGE, Feb 2007, available since SAGE version 2.1,
 \url{http://www.sagemath.org}.
