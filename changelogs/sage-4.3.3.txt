* Major features, new spkg's, and bug fixes

 * The GAP package is now upgraded to version 4.4.12.
 * Cython is now upgraded to version 0.12.1.
 * The upgrade of Pynac to version 0.1.11 also fixes about 8 tickets
   relating to symbolics.
 * Much progress is made with the Cygwin port in closing tickets
   #8267, #8279 and #8280.

* Bug statistics

We closed 131 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.3.3

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Upcoming release

The upcoming release is Sage 4.3.4, scheduled to be out after Sage
Days 20 and incorporating changes from that Sage workshop.

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.3.2, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
81.5%, with 24,596 functions. In Sage 4.3.3, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.1% and added 212 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.3.3 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.6%
 * Total number of functions:  24,808

* Known issues

 * "make test" leaves a file schemes/elliptic_curves/PRIMES in the
   sage repository. See #7575.

 * Warnings when building the HTML reference manual. See #8244.
