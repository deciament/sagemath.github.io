For details see the Sage 3.0.2 Release Tour at

  http://wiki.sagemath.org/sage-3.0.2

* Known Issues with 3.0.2:

 * clisp is broken on SLES 10/Itanium with the system 
   compiler. Building clisp 2.44.1 manually fixes the 
   problem.

* Bug Statistics

We closed a record number of 138 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-3.0.2

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 3.0.3, chaired by Michael Abshoff. 
The release is planned in about a week. It will be mostly a 
bug fix release to clear up issues from the 3.0.2 release.

For 3.0.1 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  51.8%
Total number of functions:  19553

We increased coverage by 0.4% in 3.0.2 while adding 211 functions:
