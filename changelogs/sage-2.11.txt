* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

 * ATLAS: Michael Abshoff and Burcin Erocal upgraded ATLAS to the 
   3.8.1 release. In addition tuning info for 32 bit Prescott CPUs 
   as well as Powerbook G4s under Linux was added. 

 * zn_poly: David Harvey's zn_poly library is now a standard package 
   for Sage. zn_poly is a new C library for polynomial arithmetic in 
   (Z/nZ)[x] where 3≤n≤ULONG_MAX (i.e. any machine-word-sized modulus). 
   The main benefit is speed. The library is used so far only to 
   compute the zeta function for hyperelliptic curves.

 * Small roots method for polynomials mod N (N composite): Martin 
   Albrecht implemented Coppersmith's method for finding small roots 
   of univariate polynomials modulo N where N is composite.

 * Generic Multivariate Polynomial Arithmetic: Joel Mohler improved 
   the efficiency of the generic multivariate polynomial arithmetic 
   in Sage by roughly a factor of ten. 

 * k-Schur Functions and Non-symmetric Macdonald Polynomials: Mike 
   Hansen: k-Schur functions s^(k)_\lambda are a relatively new 
   family of symmetric functions which play a role in Z[h1,...,hk] 
   as the Schur functions s_\lambda do in \Lambda. The k-Schur 
   functions, amongst other things, provide a natural basis for the 
   quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian. The k-Schur functions can 
   be used like any other symmetric functions and are created with 
   kSchurFunctions. Non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials in type A 
   can now be accessed in Sage. The polynomials are computed from 
   the main theorem in "A Combinatorial Formula for the Non-symmetric 
   Macdonald Polynomials" by Haglun, Haiman, and Loehr.

 * Marshall Hampton did upgrade gfan as well as the optional phcpack
   spkgs and their interfaces. He also increased doctest coverage to 
   100% for both interfaces.

 * Improved capabilities for solving matrix equations: William Stein 
   implemented code so that one can now solve matrix equations AX=B 
   and XA=B whenever a solution exists. In particular, solving linear 
   equations now works even if A is singular or nonsquare. 

 * Generators for congruence subgroups: Robert Miller implemented an 
   algorithm for very quickly computing generators for congruence 
   subgroups \Gamma_0(N), \Gamma_1(N), and \Gamma_H(N).

 * Various other people fixed a number of bugs and did improve other 
   bits of Sage.

* Known Issues with 2.11:

 * None

* Bug Statistics

We closed 129 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.11

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 3.0, chaired by Michael Abshoff. 
The release is planned in about two weeks. Potential features 
include:

 * DOCTESTS: Raise the doctest coverage of the Sage library 
   to 50%.
 * INTERACT: Interactive versions of functions in the notebook; 
   kind of like Mathematica's Manipulate command.
 * R: a pexpect R interface
 * TIMING/BENCHMARK: Making it so doctesting Sage also saves 
   complete timing and profiling information. Start using and 
   publishing the results of this.
 * PORTING: OSX 10.5 64 bit, FreeBSD, PPC 64 bit build support 
   out of the box. Experimental 32 bit Solaris 10 build support.
 * MODULAR ABELIAN VARIETIES: Implement Stein's algorithms for 
   computing with modular abelian varieties. This is very 
   symbolic, because Stein started the Sage project in the 
   first place specifically to implement these algorithms. 

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.10.4 we had:

Overall weighted coverage score:  47.6%
Total number of functions:  18616

We increased coverage by 1.3% in 2.11 while adding 237 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  48.9%
Total number of functions:  18853
