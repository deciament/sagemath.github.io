or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.


* Upcoming Release

The upcoming release is Sage 4.3.3, scheduled to come out after Sage
Days 20 in in Marseille, France, from February 22 to February 26,
2010. The theme of Sage Days 20 is combinatorics. For more information
on Sage Days 20, see its  official website

* Doctesting Coverage

For Sage 4.3.1, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
81.3%, with 24,397 functions. In Sage 4.3.2, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.2% and added 197 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.3.2 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.5%
 * Total number of functions:  24,594


* Known issues

The upgrade of R to version 2.10.1 solves many problems relating to R
optional packages. As of R 2.10.x, iconv is a prerequisite for
compiling R. If your system does not have an installation of iconv,
then Sage would fail to compile. The issue of iconv relating to
Solaris is tracked at ticket #8191, while that relating to Cygwin is
tracked at ticket #7319.
