* Bug statistics

We closed 55 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.4.1

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.4, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
81.7%, with 25,406 functions. In Sage 4.4.1, we added 69 new
functions. Thus for Sage 4.4.1 we now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  81.7%
 * Total number of functions:  25,475

* Known issues

When compiling the standard package sagenb, this package requires an
Internet connection to download a number of prerequisite
packages. This is should not happen because all prerequisites
necessary for sagenb to compile are contained in the sagenb spkg
itself. This issue is tracked at ticket #8861. In general, compiling
the Sage source tarball should not depend on an active Internet connection.
