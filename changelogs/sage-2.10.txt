Hello folks,

Sage 2.10 has been released on January 18th, 2008. It is available at

           http://sagemath.org/download.html

* About Sage (http://www.sagemath.org)

Sage is developed by volunteers and combines 71 open source packages.
It is available for download from sagemath.org and its mirrors in
source or binary form. If you have any questions and/or problems
please report them to the google groups sage-devel, sage-support,
sage-forum or sage-newbie. You can also drop by in #sage-devel in
freenode.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

We did not achieve all the goals we had set ourselves for Sage 2.10
and also decided to release slightly before the planned date.  The
reason was one hand the much better than expected stability of
2.10.alpha4 [it build and tested perfectly on all out test platforms]
and on the other hand the need to have a stable release for Bug Day 9
planned for this Saturday.

The following people contributed to this release:

 * Robert Bradshaw

* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

 * Python is now built with ucs4
 * FLINT was updated to the 1.0.5 release
 * Many bug fixes and also a couple of memory leak fixes
 * Integrate a fix to the mpfr library so we no longer smash
   the stack with high precisions
 * Fix a long standing, hard to hit bug in the maxima interface

* Known Issues with 2.10:

 * The mpfr fix for smashing the stack causes speed regressions,
   especially for multiplications. This ought to be fixed for the
   upcoming mpfr 2.3.1 release.
 * Any non-standard Python packages that build native components
   need to be rebuilt due to the switch from ucs2 to ucs4

We closed 83 tickets.  For details see

    http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.10

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 2.10.1, chaired by Michael Abshoff. The release
is planned for the 25th of January, 2008. Potential features include:

 * OSX 10.5 support in 64 bit mode [this will depend on fixing
   a vexing segfault in libSingular and getting disutils to
   play nice with numpy]
 * gcc 4.3 support [depends on the update to eclib.spkg]
 * FreeBSD support out of the box

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.9.3 we had:
Overall weighted coverage score:  35.2%
Total number of functions:  18100

We increased coverage by 0.2% in 2.10 while adding 196 extra functions:
Overall weighted coverage score:  35.4%
Total number of functions:  18296
