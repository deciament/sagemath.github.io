 * GLPK - GNU Linear Programming Kit
 * SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD - Build spkg's in parallel, in parallel

* Bug statistics

We closed 90 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.5

and

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-4.5.1

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Upcoming release

sage-4.5.2

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.4.4, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
82.7%, with 25727 functions. In Sage 4.5.1, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.0% and added 37 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.5 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  82.7%
 * Total number of functions:  25764

Note that this release focused mainly on spkg updates and fixes, and getting
GLPK into standard spkg's. There are many many documentation patches ready
for merging on trac, and this is one of the main goals fof sage-4.5.2.

* Known issues

Upgrading to sage-4.5 is very seriously broken, and although upgrading to
sage-4.5.1 is also broken, it is in a much less serious way.
