Hello folks,

Sage 2.10.2 has been released on February 23nd, 2008. It is available at

           http://sagemath.org/download.html

* About Sage (http://www.sagemath.org)

Sage is developed by volunteers and combines 71 open source packages.
It is available for download from sagemath.org and its mirrors in
source or binary form. If you have any questions and/or problems
please report them to the google groups sage-devel, sage-support,
You can also drop by in #sage-devel or #sage-support infreenode.

We have closed the Google Groups sage-newbie and sage-forum so 
that we can deal with support questions in sage-support only. We 
decided to close those two groups since we had various inquiries 
left unanswered due to people posting to the wrong group.

* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

 * John Voight's fast new code for enumeration of totally 
   real fields is now included.

 * David Roe's code for unramified and Eisenstein extensions 
   of Qp and Zp is now included. 

 * Clement Pernet, Burcin Erocal and William Stein have implemented
   an optimized p-adic/modular algorithm for computing Hermite
   normal forms of matrices over the integers.  For random square
   nonsingular matrices with small entries it is similar to Magma
   in speed, and vastly faster than the implementations in Gap,
   NTL, and PARI.  For matrices with large entries (e.g., 16 bits
   or more), it is faster than anything else in the world.
   For nonsquare matrices it is also reasonably good, though more
   optimization is needed since Magma is much better in some cases.
   We also implemented related code for computing determinants
   over QQ and ZZ, which is again the fastest in the world 
   especially when the matrix entries are large.  The main
   reasons for the speed of our implementation are (1) IML is fast,
   and (2) we found some tricks that are not in the literature.

 * Tim Abbott and Michael Abshoff worked on the Debianization of 
   the build process. Due to a lot of work done by Project Athena 
   at MIT Tim Abbott contributed many build scripts for chroot 
   environments. He also contributed build scripts for nearly 
   all of the SPKGs not yet in Debian. Michael Abshoff did set 
   up a test build server and while it has been shut down for 
   now the Sage project will set up another 64 bit build server 
   in the near future top provide Debian packages for a wide 
   variety of Debian based distributions.

 * Graph Theory: Robert Miller has implemented edge-labeled graph
   isomorphism, and eliminated many bugs in the main backtrack algorithm.
   He also made a few minor optimizations, and added an option which
   visualizes the structure that is searched during the running of the
   algorithm. This should make it easier to see what the algorithm is
   actually doing. Jason Grout refereed, and found another bug in the
   process, which has also been fixed.  Also every permutation
   of every graph on seven or fewer vertices has been verified to 
   give correct output.

 * Assorted bug and build fixes all over the map.

* Known Issues with 2.10.2:

 * None

* Bug Statistics

We closed 156 tickets. For details see

   http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/milestone/sage-2.10.2

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the 
announcement. 

* Upcoming Releases

The next release will be 2.10.3, chaired by Michael Abshoff and 
Robert Miller. The release is planned post Sage Days 8, but 
details are sketchy at the moment. Potential features include:

 * OSX 10.5 support in 64 bit mode [this will depend on fixing
   a vexing segfault in libSingular and getting disutils to
   play nice with numpy]
 * gcc 4.3 support out of the box
 * FreeBSD support out of the box
 * Improved experimental Solaris support

* Doctesting Coverage

For 2.10.1 we had:
Overall weighted coverage score:  38.3%
Total number of functions:  18290

We increased coverage by 1.8% in 2.10.2 while adding 238 functions:

Overall weighted coverage score:  40.1%
Total number of functions:  18528
