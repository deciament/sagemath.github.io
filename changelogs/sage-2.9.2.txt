* Major Features, New Spkgs and Bugfixes

The 2.9.2 release was mostly a bug fix release, specifically aimed at 
the  AMS meeting in San Diego. The main new features are

 * Much, much improved 3D plots by the integration of jmol 
   (this involved substantial new code by Robert Bradshaw and 
   William Stein)
 * Many build fixes and build improvements

We closed 33 tickets, mostly because we were very, very conservative 
for this release. For details see below or our tracker at

* Known Issues with 2.9.2

#1497: ATLAS can fail to build on multi core Linux boxen when 
       power management is activated. This is a known ATLAS

The next release will be 2.10, chaired by Michael Abshoff. The release 
should happen in about a week from the release of 2.9.2. Planned 
features are:

For 2.9.2:

Overall weighted coverage score:  35.2%
