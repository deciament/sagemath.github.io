* Bug statistics

We closed 119 tickets. For details see

or check out the closed ticket section at the end of the announcement.

* Doctesting coverage

For Sage 4.4.3, we had an overall weighted doctest coverage score of
82.1%, with 25,516 functions. In Sage 4.4.4, we increased the doctest
coverage by 0.6% and added 211 new functions. Thus for Sage 4.4.4 we
now have

 * Overall weighted coverage score:  82.7%
 * Total number of functions:  25,727
