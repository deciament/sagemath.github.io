SAGE - 2.8.6


 * Change Sage library to "GPL version >= 2."

 * Robert Bradshaw -- upgrade Cython

 * Martin Albrecht -- upgrade singular

 * Jason Grout (refereed by Robert Miller) -- lots of updates to the graph theory package

 * Mike Hansen -- updates to combinatorics; improved how multi-variate poly rings print.

 * William Stein -- many bug fixes

 * Martin Albrecht -- many small improvements to commutative algebra

 * Joel Mohler -- optimizations

 * Soroosh Yazdani -- improvements to smith normal form

 * Gonzalo Tornaria and William Stein -- made pari c library interface automatically 
                                         increase memory as needed

 * Craig Citro and William Stein -- improvements to scons so that branch switching works.
